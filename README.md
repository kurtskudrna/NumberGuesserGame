# Number Guesser Game
This project is a game that randomly chooses a number between 1-10 and you will speak into your microphone on your computer to guess the number. 
It will either be correct, too low, too high or not a number.
## Motivation
My motivation for this project is I thought that using voice recognition would be interesting. 
I found that once I was able to get what the window.SpeechRecognition() function was recieving, 
I would just have to direct the correct HTML to respond back to the user.
